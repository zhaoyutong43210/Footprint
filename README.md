# Footprint

## Preface

The motivation of starting this project is quite simple, I would like to know where I have been for my past of life and make a map to visulize it. 
Inspired by the app such as "Fog of World", and after losing the record for too lazy to backup the data. I decide to make my footprint my own way.

### Alltrails export

In Alltrails, the trace of your past activity can be exported. 
When viewing your recorded activities, you can click the three dots icon, go to "download route", select the "GPX track" and you can get a `*.gpx` file. 
Repeat this for different activities until you satisfied.

Of course, you could have forgot to record you own activity. You can download the "offical" trail, and rename it tailling with date such as `yourfilename_#20240101`. 
By doing so, your activity can also be recorded. (Just not as accurate as reality, but it's a good approximation!)
